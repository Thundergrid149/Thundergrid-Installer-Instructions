# Etrel Load Guard Troubleshooting Options
## Check Data
Check that the data cable is fully plugged into the charger and Load Guard at both ends 

## Power Cycle
Power cycle the Load Guard. Switch off the breaker for the Load Guard only for 5-10 seconds, then power back on.  

## Remote Support

The charger service menu can be opened by holding down the white button inside the charger access panel for 2-3 seconds. The button is located near the ethernet port on the charger. The charger should make a beep when the menu has been successfully accessed.
