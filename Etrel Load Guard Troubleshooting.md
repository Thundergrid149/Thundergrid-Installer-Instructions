The charger service menu can be opened by holding down the white button inside the charger access panel for 2-3 seconds. The button is located near the ethernet port on the charger. The charger should make a beep when the menu has been successfully accessed.

# Other Load Guard Installation Tips & Checks
## CT Clamp Orientation
The CT clamps for the Load Guard have to be orientated in the correct direction for the load management system to work.

The CT clamps have an arrow inside of them. This should be facing the same direction as the flow of power.

The Load Guard should be reading a positive value when power is being drawn from the building. This can be checked in the service menu next to the Load Guard status. You should see a positive number next to the Load Guard status.

Please note, that the length of the CTs can not be extended beyond the length of the factory wire lengths.
