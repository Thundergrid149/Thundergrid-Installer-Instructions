# Etrel Load Guard Troubleshooting Options
## Check Data
Check that the data cable is fully plugged into the charger and Load Guard at both ends 

## Power Cycle
Power cycle the Load Guard. Switch off the breaker for the Load Guard only for 5-10 seconds, then power back on.  

## Remote Support
Otherwise: call Thundergrid to remote into the charger to double-check this connectivity: `0800 387 877`

# Check Load Guard Status
> [!NOTE]
> The charger has to be on FW `5.1` or higher
1. Open the service menu

The charger service menu can be opened by holding down the white button inside the charger access panel for 2-3 seconds. The button is located near the ethernet port on the charger. The charger should make a beep when the menu has been successfully accessed.

# Other Load Guard Installation Tips & Checks: 

Siting the little ‘arrow’ within the CT should be facing the direction of the current it is reading 

Checking the LG is powered on and is correctly wired 

Checking the length of the CTs have not been extended beyond the length of the factory wire lengths 

Photograph of the installed LG showing how it is wired, especially important for 3-phase installations as it is not possible to remotely identify an incorrect wiring 

In the Charger’s Configuration, checking the SN of the Load Guard matches that of the installed Load Guard. Vice versa, in the Load Guard configurator app when connected to the Load Guard, ensure that both the Serial Number of the charger and its Static IP address are correct.
